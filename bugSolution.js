The solution involves replacing any attempt to use unsupported native modules or direct device access with the appropriate Expo APIs.  Expo provides a rich set of modules for common tasks like camera access, location services, and other device-related functions.  

For example, instead of directly accessing the camera using native code, use the `expo-camera` library.  This ensures cross-platform compatibility and avoids the runtime errors.  Always check the Expo documentation for available APIs before resorting to native modules in a managed workflow.
