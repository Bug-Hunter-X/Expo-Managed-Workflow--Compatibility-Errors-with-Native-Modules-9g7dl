This error typically occurs when you try to use a feature or module in your Expo managed workflow app that isn't compatible with the Expo Go app or the EAS Build system.  This often involves using native modules or functionalities that require direct access to the device's capabilities beyond what Expo Go or EAS Build provides. For example, directly accessing the camera without using the Expo Camera API, accessing low-level system settings, or employing certain third-party libraries without Expo compatibility.  The exact manifestation of the error may vary depending on the specific feature being used and the platform (iOS or Android).
